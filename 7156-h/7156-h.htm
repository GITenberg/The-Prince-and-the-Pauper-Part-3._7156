<p>Chapter VIII. The question of the Seal.</p>

<p>About five o'clock Henry VIII. awoke out of an unrefreshing nap, and
muttered to himself, "Troublous dreams, troublous dreams! Mine end is now
at hand: &nbsp;so say these warnings, and my failing pulses do confirm it."
Presently a wicked light flamed up in his eye, and he muttered, "Yet will
not I die till HE go before."</p>

<p>His attendants perceiving that he was awake, one of them asked his
pleasure concerning the Lord Chancellor, who was waiting without.</p>

<p>"Admit him, admit him!" exclaimed the King eagerly.</p>

<p>The Lord Chancellor entered, and knelt by the King's couch, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have given order, and, according to the King's command, the peers of
the realm, in their robes, do now stand at the bar of the House, where,
having confirmed the Duke of Norfolk's doom, they humbly wait his
majesty's further pleasure in the matter."</p>

<p>The King's face lit up with a fierce joy. &nbsp;Said he&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lift me up! &nbsp;In mine own person will I go before my Parliament, and with
mine own hand will I seal the warrant that rids me of&mdash;"</p>

<p>His voice failed; an ashen pallor swept the flush from his cheeks; and
the attendants eased him back upon his pillows, and hurriedly assisted
him with restoratives. &nbsp;Presently he said sorrowfully&mdash;</p>

<p>"Alack, how have I longed for this sweet hour! and lo, too late it
cometh, and I am robbed of this so coveted chance. &nbsp;But speed ye, speed
ye! let others do this happy office sith 'tis denied to me. I put my
Great Seal in commission: &nbsp;choose thou the lords that shall compose it,
and get ye to your work. &nbsp;Speed ye, man! &nbsp;Before the sun shall rise and
set again, bring me his head that I may see it."</p>

<p>"According to the King's command, so shall it be. &nbsp;Will't please your
majesty to order that the Seal be now restored to me, so that I may forth
upon the business?"</p>

<br><br>
<a name="08-098"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="08-098.jpg (99K)" src="images/08-098.jpg" height="603" width="712">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>"The Seal? &nbsp;Who keepeth the Seal but thou?"</p>

<p>"Please your majesty, you did take it from me two days since, saying it
should no more do its office till your own royal hand should use it upon
the Duke of Norfolk's warrant."</p>

<p>"Why, so in sooth I did: &nbsp;I do remember . . . What did I with it?. . . I
am very feeble . . . So oft these days doth my memory play the traitor
with me . . . 'Tis strange, strange&mdash;"</p>

<p>The King dropped into inarticulate mumblings, shaking his grey head
weakly from time to time, and gropingly trying to recollect what he had
done with the Seal. &nbsp;At last my Lord Hertford ventured to kneel and offer
information&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sire, if that I may be so bold, here be several that do remember with me
how that you gave the Great Seal into the hands of his highness the
Prince of Wales to keep against the day that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"True, most true!" interrupted the King. &nbsp;"Fetch it! &nbsp;Go: &nbsp;time flieth!"</p>

<p>Lord Hertford flew to Tom, but returned to the King before very long,
troubled and empty-handed. &nbsp;He delivered himself to this effect&mdash;</p>

<p>"It grieveth me, my lord the King, to bear so heavy and unwelcome
tidings; but it is the will of God that the prince's affliction abideth
still, and he cannot recall to mind that he received the Seal. &nbsp;So came I
quickly to report, thinking it were waste of precious time, and little
worth withal, that any should attempt to search the long array of
chambers and saloons that belong unto his royal high&mdash;"</p>

<p>A groan from the King interrupted the lord at this point. &nbsp;After a little
while his majesty said, with a deep sadness in his tone&mdash;</p>

<p>"Trouble him no more, poor child. &nbsp;The hand of God lieth heavy upon him,
and my heart goeth out in loving compassion for him, and sorrow that I
may not bear his burden on mine old trouble-weighted shoulders, and so
bring him peace."</p>

<p>He closed his eyes, fell to mumbling, and presently was silent. After a
time he opened his eyes again, and gazed vacantly around until his glance
rested upon the kneeling Lord Chancellor. Instantly his face flushed with
wrath&mdash;</p>

<p>"What, thou here yet! &nbsp;By the glory of God, an' thou gettest not about
that traitor's business, thy mitre shall have holiday the morrow for lack
of a head to grace withal!"</p>

<p>The trembling Chancellor answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good your Majesty, I cry you mercy! &nbsp;I but waited for the Seal."</p>

<p>"Man, hast lost thy wits? &nbsp;The small Seal which aforetime I was wont to
take with me abroad lieth in my treasury. &nbsp;And, since the Great Seal hath
flown away, shall not it suffice? &nbsp;Hast lost thy wits? &nbsp;Begone! &nbsp;And hark
ye&mdash;come no more till thou do bring his head."</p>

<p>The poor Chancellor was not long in removing himself from this dangerous
vicinity; nor did the commission waste time in giving the royal assent to
the work of the slavish Parliament, and appointing the morrow for the
beheading of the premier peer of England, the luckless Duke of Norfolk.

<p>Chapter IX. The river pageant.</p>

<p>At nine in the evening the whole vast river-front of the palace was
blazing with light. &nbsp;The river itself, as far as the eye could reach
citywards, was so thickly covered with watermen's boats and with
pleasure-barges, all fringed with coloured lanterns, and gently agitated
by the waves, that it resembled a glowing and limitless garden of flowers
stirred to soft motion by summer winds. &nbsp;The grand terrace of stone steps
leading down to the water, spacious enough to mass the army of a German
principality upon, was a picture to see, with its ranks of royal
halberdiers in polished armour, and its troops of brilliantly costumed
servitors flitting up and down, and to and fro, in the hurry of
preparation.</p>

<p>Presently a command was given, and immediately all living creatures
vanished from the steps. &nbsp;Now the air was heavy with the hush of suspense
and expectancy. &nbsp;As far as one's vision could carry, he might see the
myriads of people in the boats rise up, and shade their eyes from the
glare of lanterns and torches, and gaze toward the palace.</p>

<p>A file of forty or fifty state barges drew up to the steps. &nbsp;They were
richly gilt, and their lofty prows and sterns were elaborately carved.
Some of them were decorated with banners and streamers; some with
cloth-of-gold and arras embroidered with coats-of-arms; others with silken
flags that had numberless little silver bells fastened to them, which
shook out tiny showers of joyous music whenever the breezes fluttered
them; others of yet higher pretensions, since they belonged to nobles in
the prince's immediate service, had their sides picturesquely fenced with
shields gorgeously emblazoned with armorial bearings. &nbsp;Each state barge
was towed by a tender. &nbsp;Besides the rowers, these tenders carried each a
number of men-at-arms in glossy helmet and breastplate, and a company of
musicians.</p>

<br><br>

</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>The advance-guard of the expected procession now appeared in the great
gateway, a troop of halberdiers. &nbsp;'They were dressed in striped hose of
black and tawny, velvet caps graced at the sides with silver roses, and
doublets of murrey and blue cloth, embroidered on the front and back with
the three feathers, the prince's blazon, woven in gold. &nbsp;Their halberd
staves were covered with crimson velvet, fastened with gilt nails, and
ornamented with gold tassels. &nbsp;Filing off on the right and left, they
formed two long lines, extending from the gateway of the palace to the
water's edge. &nbsp;A thick rayed cloth or carpet was then unfolded, and laid
down between them by attendants in the gold-and-crimson liveries of the
prince. &nbsp;This done, a flourish of trumpets resounded from within. &nbsp;A
lively prelude arose from the musicians on the water; and two ushers with
white wands marched with a slow and stately pace from the portal. &nbsp;They
were followed by an officer bearing the civic mace, after whom came
another carrying the city's sword; then several sergeants of the city
guard, in their full accoutrements, and with badges on their sleeves;
then the Garter King-at-arms, in his tabard; then several Knights of the
Bath, each with a white lace on his sleeve; then their esquires; then the
judges, in their robes of scarlet and coifs; then the Lord High
Chancellor of England, in a robe of scarlet, open before, and purfled
with minever; then a deputation of aldermen, in their scarlet cloaks; and
then the heads of the different civic companies, in their robes of state.
Now came twelve French gentlemen, in splendid habiliments, consisting of
pourpoints of white damask barred with gold, short mantles of crimson
velvet lined with violet taffeta, and carnation coloured
hauts-de-chausses, and took their way down the steps. &nbsp;They were of the suite of
the French ambassador, and were followed by twelve cavaliers of the suite
of the Spanish ambassador, clothed in black velvet, unrelieved by any
ornament. &nbsp;Following these came several great English nobles with their
attendants.'</p>

<p>There was a flourish of trumpets within; and the Prince's uncle, the
future great Duke of Somerset, emerged from the gateway, arrayed in a
'doublet of black cloth-of-gold, and a cloak of crimson satin flowered
with gold, and ribanded with nets of silver.' &nbsp;He turned, doffed his
plumed cap, bent his body in a low reverence, and began to step backward,
bowing at each step. &nbsp;A prolonged trumpet-blast followed, and a
proclamation, "Way for the high and mighty the Lord Edward, Prince of
Wales!" &nbsp;High aloft on the palace walls a long line of red tongues of
flame leapt forth with a thunder-crash; the massed world on the river
burst into a mighty roar of welcome; and Tom Canty, the cause and hero of
it all, stepped into view and slightly bowed his princely head.</p>

<p>He was 'magnificently habited in a doublet of white satin, with a
front-piece of purple cloth-of-tissue, powdered with diamonds, and edged with
ermine. &nbsp;Over this he wore a mantle of white cloth-of-gold, pounced with
the triple-feathered crest, lined with blue satin, set with pearls and
precious stones, and fastened with a clasp of brilliants. &nbsp;About his neck
hung the order of the Garter, and several princely foreign orders;' and
wherever light fell upon him jewels responded with a blinding flash. &nbsp;O
Tom Canty, born in a hovel, bred in the gutters of London, familiar with
rags and dirt and misery, what a spectacle is this!</p>

<p>Chapter X. The Prince in the toils.</p>

<p>We left John Canty dragging the rightful prince into Offal Court, with a
noisy and delighted mob at his heels. &nbsp;There was but one person in it who
offered a pleading word for the captive, and he was not heeded; he was
hardly even heard, so great was the turmoil. &nbsp;The Prince continued to
struggle for freedom, and to rage against the treatment he was suffering,
until John Canty lost what little patience was left in him, and raised
his oaken cudgel in a sudden fury over the Prince's head. &nbsp;The single
pleader for the lad sprang to stop the man's arm, and the blow descended
upon his own wrist. &nbsp;Canty roared out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thou'lt meddle, wilt thou? &nbsp;Then have thy reward."</p>

<br><br>
<a name="10-110"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="10-110.jpg (100K)" src="images/10-110.jpg" height="568" width="542">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>His cudgel crashed down upon the meddler's head: &nbsp;there was a groan, a
dim form sank to the ground among the feet of the crowd, and the next
moment it lay there in the dark alone. &nbsp;The mob pressed on, their
enjoyment nothing disturbed by this episode.</p>

<p>Presently the Prince found himself in John Canty's abode, with the door
closed against the outsiders. &nbsp;By the vague light of a tallow candle
which was thrust into a bottle, he made out the main features of the
loathsome den, and also the occupants of it. &nbsp;Two frowsy girls and a
middle-aged woman cowered against the wall in one corner, with the aspect
of animals habituated to harsh usage, and expecting and dreading it now.
From another corner stole a withered hag with streaming grey hair and
malignant eyes. &nbsp;John Canty said to this one&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tarry! &nbsp;There's fine mummeries here. &nbsp;Mar them not till thou'st enjoyed
them: &nbsp;then let thy hand be heavy as thou wilt. &nbsp;Stand forth, lad. &nbsp;Now
say thy foolery again, an thou'st not forgot it. Name thy name. &nbsp;Who art
thou?"</p>

<p>The insulted blood mounted to the little prince's cheek once more, and he
lifted a steady and indignant gaze to the man's face and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Tis but ill-breeding in such as thou to command me to speak. &nbsp;I tell
thee now, as I told thee before, I am Edward, Prince of Wales, and none
other."</p>

<br><br>
<a name="10-111"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="10-111.jpg (133K)" src="images/10-111.jpg" height="698" width="724">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>


<p>The stunning surprise of this reply nailed the hag's feet to the floor
where she stood, and almost took her breath. &nbsp;She stared at the Prince in
stupid amazement, which so amused her ruffianly son, that he burst into a
roar of laughter. &nbsp;But the effect upon Tom Canty's mother and sisters was
different. &nbsp;Their dread of bodily injury gave way at once to distress of
a different sort. &nbsp;They ran forward with woe and dismay in their faces,
exclaiming&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, poor Tom, poor lad!"</p>

<p>The mother fell on her knees before the Prince, put her hands upon his
shoulders, and gazed yearningly into his face through her rising tears.
Then she said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, my poor boy! &nbsp;Thy foolish reading hath wrought its woeful work at
last, and ta'en thy wit away. &nbsp;Ah! why did'st thou cleave to it when I so
warned thee 'gainst it? &nbsp;Thou'st broke thy mother's heart."</p>

<p>The Prince looked into her face, and said gently&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thy son is well, and hath not lost his wits, good dame. &nbsp;Comfort thee:
let me to the palace where he is, and straightway will the King my father
restore him to thee."</p>

<p>"The King thy father! &nbsp;Oh, my child! unsay these words that be freighted
with death for thee, and ruin for all that be near to thee. &nbsp;Shake of
this gruesome dream. &nbsp;Call back thy poor wandering memory. &nbsp;Look upon me.
Am not I thy mother that bore thee, and loveth thee?"</p>

<p>The Prince shook his head and reluctantly said&mdash;</p>

<p>"God knoweth I am loth to grieve thy heart; but truly have I never looked
upon thy face before."</p>

<p>The woman sank back to a sitting posture on the floor, and, covering her
eyes with her hands, gave way to heart-broken sobs and wailings.</p>

<p>"Let the show go on!" shouted Canty. &nbsp;"What, Nan!&mdash;what, Bet! mannerless
wenches! will ye stand in the Prince's presence? &nbsp;Upon your knees, ye
pauper scum, and do him reverence!"</p>

<p>He followed this with another horse-laugh. &nbsp;The girls began to plead
timidly for their brother; and Nan said&mdash;</p>

<p>"An thou wilt but let him to bed, father, rest and sleep will heal his
madness: &nbsp;prithee, do."</p>

<p>"Do, father," said Bet; "he is more worn than is his wont. &nbsp;To-morrow
will he be himself again, and will beg with diligence, and come not empty
home again."</p>

<p>This remark sobered the father's joviality, and brought his mind to
business. &nbsp;He turned angrily upon the Prince, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"The morrow must we pay two pennies to him that owns this hole; two
pennies, mark ye&mdash;all this money for a half-year's rent, else out of this
we go. &nbsp;Show what thou'st gathered with thy lazy begging."</p>

<p>The Prince said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Offend me not with thy sordid matters. &nbsp;I tell thee again I am the
King's son."</p>

<p>A sounding blow upon the Prince's shoulder from Canty's broad palm sent
him staggering into goodwife Canty's arms, who clasped him to her breast,
and sheltered him from a pelting rain of cuffs and slaps by interposing
her own person. &nbsp;The frightened girls retreated to their corner; but the
grandmother stepped eagerly forward to assist her son. &nbsp;The Prince sprang
away from Mrs. Canty, exclaiming&mdash;</p>

<br><br>
<a name="10-113"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="10-113.jpg (105K)" src="images/10-113.jpg" height="573" width="720">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>


<p>"Thou shalt not suffer for me, madam. &nbsp;Let these swine do their will upon
me alone."</p>

<p>This speech infuriated the swine to such a degree that they set about
their work without waste of time. &nbsp;Between them they belaboured the boy
right soundly, and then gave the girls and their mother a beating for
showing sympathy for the victim.</p>

<p>"Now," said Canty, "to bed, all of ye. &nbsp;The entertainment has tired me."</p>

<p>The light was put out, and the family retired. &nbsp;As soon as the snorings
of the head of the house and his mother showed that they were asleep, the
young girls crept to where the Prince lay, and covered him tenderly from
the cold with straw and rags; and their mother crept to him also, and
stroked his hair, and cried over him, whispering broken words of comfort
and compassion in his ear the while. &nbsp;She had saved a morsel for him to
eat, also; but the boy's pains had swept away all appetite&mdash;at least for
black and tasteless crusts. &nbsp;He was touched by her brave and costly
defence of him, and by her commiseration; and he thanked her in very
noble and princely words, and begged her to go to her sleep and try to
forget her sorrows. &nbsp;And he added that the King his father would not let
her loyal kindness and devotion go unrewarded. &nbsp;This return to his
'madness' broke her heart anew, and she strained him to her breast again
and again, and then went back, drowned in tears, to her bed.</p>

<p>As she lay thinking and mourning, the suggestion began to creep into her
mind that there was an undefinable something about this boy that was
lacking in Tom Canty, mad or sane. &nbsp;She could not describe it, she could
not tell just what it was, and yet her sharp mother-instinct seemed to
detect it and perceive it. &nbsp;What if the boy were really not her son,
after all? &nbsp;Oh, absurd! &nbsp;She almost smiled at the idea, spite of her
griefs and troubles. &nbsp;No matter, she found that it was an idea that would
not 'down,' but persisted in haunting her. &nbsp;It pursued her, it harassed
her, it clung to her, and refused to be put away or ignored. &nbsp;At last she
perceived that there was not going to be any peace for her until she
should devise a test that should prove, clearly and without question,
whether this lad was her son or not, and so banish these wearing and
worrying doubts. &nbsp;Ah, yes, this was plainly the right way out of the
difficulty; therefore she set her wits to work at once to contrive that
test. &nbsp;But it was an easier thing to propose than to accomplish. &nbsp;She
turned over in her mind one promising test after another, but was obliged
to relinquish them all&mdash;none of them were absolutely sure, absolutely
perfect; and an imperfect one could not satisfy her. &nbsp;Evidently she was
racking her head in vain&mdash;it seemed manifest that she must give the
matter up. &nbsp;While this depressing thought was passing through her mind,
her ear caught the regular breathing of the boy, and she knew he had
fallen asleep. &nbsp;And while she listened, the measured breathing was broken
by a soft, startled cry, such as one utters in a troubled dream. &nbsp;This
chance occurrence furnished her instantly with a plan worth all her
laboured tests combined. &nbsp;She at once set herself feverishly, but
noiselessly, to work to relight her candle, muttering to herself, "Had I
but seen him THEN, I should have known! &nbsp;Since that day, when he was
little, that the powder burst in his face, he hath never been startled of
a sudden out of his dreams or out of his thinkings, but he hath cast his
hand before his eyes, even as he did that day; and not as others would do
it, with the palm inward, but always with the palm turned outward&mdash;I have
seen it a hundred times, and it hath never varied nor ever failed. &nbsp;Yes,
I shall soon know, now!"</p>

<p>By this time she had crept to the slumbering boy's side, with the candle,
shaded, in her hand. &nbsp;She bent heedfully and warily over him, scarcely
breathing in her suppressed excitement, and suddenly flashed the light in
his face and struck the floor by his ear with her knuckles. &nbsp;The
sleeper's eyes sprang wide open, and he cast a startled stare about
him&mdash;but he made no special movement with his hands.</p>

<br><br><br><br>


<p>The poor woman was smitten almost helpless with surprise and grief; but
she contrived to hide her emotions, and to soothe the boy to sleep again;
then she crept apart and communed miserably with herself upon the
disastrous result of her experiment. &nbsp;She tried to believe that her Tom's
madness had banished this habitual gesture of his; but she could not do
it. &nbsp;"No," she said, "his HANDS are not mad; they could not unlearn so
old a habit in so brief a time. &nbsp;Oh, this is a heavy day for me!"</p>

<p>Still, hope was as stubborn now as doubt had been before; she could not
bring herself to accept the verdict of the test; she must try the thing
again&mdash;the failure must have been only an accident; so she startled the
boy out of his sleep a second and a third time, at intervals&mdash;with the
same result which had marked the first test; then she dragged herself to
bed, and fell sorrowfully asleep, saying, "But I cannot give him up&mdash;oh
no, I cannot, I cannot&mdash;he MUST be my boy!"</p>

<p>The poor mother's interruptions having ceased, and the Prince's pains
having gradually lost their power to disturb him, utter weariness at last
sealed his eyes in a profound and restful sleep. Hour after hour slipped
away, and still he slept like the dead. Thus four or five hours passed.
Then his stupor began to lighten. Presently, while half asleep and half
awake, he murmured&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir William!"</p>

<p>After a moment&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ho, Sir William Herbert! &nbsp;Hie thee hither, and list to the strangest
dream that ever . . . Sir William! dost hear? &nbsp;Man, I did think me
changed to a pauper, and . . . Ho there! &nbsp;Guards! Sir William! &nbsp;What! is
there no groom of the chamber in waiting? Alack! it shall go hard with&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What aileth thee?" asked a whisper near him. &nbsp;"Who art thou calling?"</p>

<p>"Sir William Herbert. &nbsp;Who art thou?"</p>

<p>"I? &nbsp;Who should I be, but thy sister Nan? &nbsp;Oh, Tom, I had forgot! Thou'rt
mad yet&mdash;poor lad, thou'rt mad yet: &nbsp;would I had never woke to know it
again! &nbsp;But prithee master thy tongue, lest we be all beaten till we
die!"</p>

<p>The startled Prince sprang partly up, but a sharp reminder from his
stiffened bruises brought him to himself, and he sank back among his foul
straw with a moan and the ejaculation&mdash;</p>

<p>"Alas! it was no dream, then!"</p>

<p>In a moment all the heavy sorrow and misery which sleep had banished were
upon him again, and he realised that he was no longer a petted prince in
a palace, with the adoring eyes of a nation upon him, but a pauper, an
outcast, clothed in rags, prisoner in a den fit only for beasts, and
consorting with beggars and thieves.</p>

<p>In the midst of his grief he began to be conscious of hilarious noises
and shoutings, apparently but a block or two away. &nbsp;The next moment there
were several sharp raps at the door; John Canty ceased from snoring and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who knocketh? &nbsp;What wilt thou?"</p>

<p>A voice answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Know'st thou who it was thou laid thy cudgel on?"</p>

<p>"No. &nbsp;Neither know I, nor care."</p>

<p>"Belike thou'lt change thy note eftsoons. &nbsp;An thou would save thy neck,
nothing but flight may stead thee. &nbsp;The man is this moment delivering up
the ghost. &nbsp;'Tis the priest, Father Andrew!"</p>

<p>"God-a-mercy!" exclaimed Canty. &nbsp;He roused his family, and hoarsely
commanded, "Up with ye all and fly&mdash;or bide where ye are and perish!"</p>

<p>Scarcely five minutes later the Canty household were in the street and
flying for their lives. &nbsp;John Canty held the Prince by the wrist, and
hurried him along the dark way, giving him this caution in a low voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mind thy tongue, thou mad fool, and speak not our name. &nbsp;I will choose
me a new name, speedily, to throw the law's dogs off the scent. &nbsp;Mind thy
tongue, I tell thee!"</p>

<br><br>

</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>He growled these words to the rest of the family&mdash;</p>

<p>"If it so chance that we be separated, let each make for London Bridge;
whoso findeth himself as far as the last linen-draper's shop on the
bridge, let him tarry there till the others be come, then will we flee
into Southwark together."</p>

<p>At this moment the party burst suddenly out of darkness into light; and
not only into light, but into the midst of a multitude of singing,
dancing, and shouting people, massed together on the river frontage.
There was a line of bonfires stretching as far as one could see, up and
down the Thames; London Bridge was illuminated; Southwark Bridge
likewise; the entire river was aglow with the flash and sheen of coloured
lights; and constant explosions of fireworks filled the skies with an
intricate commingling of shooting splendours and a thick rain of dazzling
sparks that almost turned night into day; everywhere were crowds of
revellers; all London seemed to be at large.</p>

<p>John Canty delivered himself of a furious curse and commanded a retreat;
but it was too late. &nbsp;He and his tribe were swallowed up in that swarming
hive of humanity, and hopelessly separated from each other in an instant.
We are not considering that the Prince was one of his tribe; Canty still
kept his grip upon him. &nbsp;The Prince's heart was beating high with hopes
of escape, now. &nbsp;A burly waterman, considerably exalted with liquor,
found himself rudely shoved by Canty in his efforts to plough through the
crowd; he laid his great hand on Canty's shoulder and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nay, whither so fast, friend? &nbsp;Dost canker thy soul with sordid business
when all that be leal men and true make holiday?"</p>

<p>"Mine affairs are mine own, they concern thee not," answered Canty,
roughly; "take away thy hand and let me pass."</p>

<p>"Sith that is thy humour, thou'lt NOT pass, till thou'st drunk to the
Prince of Wales, I tell thee that," said the waterman, barring the way
resolutely.</p>

<p>"Give me the cup, then, and make speed, make speed!"</p>

<p>Other revellers were interested by this time. &nbsp;They cried out&mdash;</p>

<p>"The loving-cup, the loving-cup! make the sour knave drink the
loving-cup, else will we feed him to the fishes."</p>

<p>So a huge loving-cup was brought; the waterman, grasping it by one of its
handles, and with the other hand bearing up the end of an imaginary
napkin, presented it in due and ancient form to Canty, who had to grasp
the opposite handle with one of his hands and take off the lid with the
other, according to ancient custom.  This left the Prince hand-free
for a second, of course. &nbsp;He wasted no time, but dived among the forest
of legs about him and disappeared. &nbsp;In another moment he could not have
been harder to find, under that tossing sea of life, if its billows had
been the Atlantic's and he a lost sixpence.</p>

</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>He very soon realised this fact, and straightway busied himself about his
own affairs without further thought of John Canty. &nbsp;He quickly realised
another thing, too. &nbsp;To wit, that a spurious Prince of Wales was being
feasted by the city in his stead. &nbsp;He easily concluded that the pauper
lad, Tom Canty, had deliberately taken advantage of his stupendous
opportunity and become a usurper.</p>

<p>Therefore there was but one course to pursue&mdash;find his way to the
Guildhall, make himself known, and denounce the impostor. &nbsp;He also made
up his mind that Tom should be allowed a reasonable time for spiritual
preparation, and then be hanged, drawn and quartered, according to the
law and usage of the day in cases of high treason.</p>

<p>
Chapter XI. At Guildhall.</p>

<p>The royal barge, attended by its gorgeous fleet, took its stately way
down the Thames through the wilderness of illuminated boats. The air was
laden with music; the river banks were beruffled with joy-flames; the
distant city lay in a soft luminous glow from its countless invisible
bonfires; above it rose many a slender spire into the sky, incrusted with
sparkling lights, wherefore in their remoteness they seemed like jewelled
lances thrust aloft; as the fleet swept along, it was greeted from the
banks with a continuous hoarse roar of cheers and the ceaseless flash and
boom of artillery.</p>

<p>To Tom Canty, half buried in his silken cushions, these sounds and this
spectacle were a wonder unspeakably sublime and astonishing. To his
little friends at his side, the Princess Elizabeth and the Lady Jane
Grey, they were nothing.</p>

<p>Arrived at the Dowgate, the fleet was towed up the limpid Walbrook (whose
channel has now been for two centuries buried out of sight under acres of
buildings) to Bucklersbury, past houses and under bridges populous with
merry-makers and brilliantly lighted, and at last came to a halt in a
basin where now is Barge Yard, in the centre of the ancient city of
London. &nbsp;Tom disembarked, and he and his gallant procession crossed
Cheapside and made a short march through the Old Jewry and Basinghall
Street to the Guildhall.</p>

<p>Tom and his little ladies were received with due ceremony by the Lord
Mayor and the Fathers of the City, in their gold chains and scarlet robes
of state, and conducted to a rich canopy of state at the head of the
great hall, preceded by heralds making proclamation, and by the Mace and
the City Sword. &nbsp;The lords and ladies who were to attend upon Tom and his
two small friends took their places behind their chairs.</p>

<br><br>
<a name="11-124"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="11-124.jpg (173K)" src="images/11-124.jpg" height="1063" width="729">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>At a lower table the Court grandees and other guests of noble degree were
seated, with the magnates of the city; the commoners took places at a
multitude of tables on the main floor of the hall. &nbsp;From their lofty
vantage-ground the giants Gog and Magog, the ancient guardians of the
city, contemplated the spectacle below them with eyes grown familiar to
it in forgotten generations. &nbsp;There was a bugle-blast and a proclamation,
and a fat butler appeared in a high perch in the leftward wall, followed
by his servitors bearing with impressive solemnity a royal baron of beef,
smoking hot and ready for the knife.</p>

<p>After grace, Tom (being instructed) rose&mdash;and the whole house with
him&mdash;and drank from a portly golden loving-cup with the Princess Elizabeth;
from her it passed to the Lady Jane, and then traversed the general
assemblage. &nbsp;So the banquet began.</p>

<p>By midnight the revelry was at its height. &nbsp;Now came one of those
picturesque spectacles so admired in that old day. &nbsp;A description of it
is still extant in the quaint wording of a chronicler who witnessed it:</p>

<p>'Space being made, presently entered a baron and an earl appareled after
the Turkish fashion in long robes of bawdkin powdered with gold; hats on
their heads of crimson velvet, with great rolls of gold, girded with two
swords, called scimitars, hanging by great bawdricks of gold. &nbsp;Next came
yet another baron and another earl, in two long gowns of yellow satin,
traversed with white satin, and in every bend of white was a bend of
crimson satin, after the fashion of Russia, with furred hats of gray on
their heads; either of them having an hatchet in their hands, and boots
with pykes' (points a foot long), 'turned up. &nbsp;And after them came a
knight, then the Lord High Admiral, and with him five nobles, in doublets
of crimson velvet, voyded low on the back and before to the cannell-bone,
laced on the breasts with chains of silver; and over that, short cloaks
of crimson satin, and on their heads hats after the dancers' fashion,
with pheasants' feathers in them. &nbsp;These were appareled after the fashion
of Prussia. &nbsp;The torchbearers, which were about an hundred, were
appareled in crimson satin and green, like Moors, their faces black.
Next came in a mommarye. Then the minstrels, which were disguised,
danced; and the lords and ladies did wildly dance also, that it was a
pleasure to behold.'</p>

<p>And while Tom, in his high seat, was gazing upon this 'wild' dancing,
lost in admiration of the dazzling commingling of kaleidoscopic colours
which the whirling turmoil of gaudy figures below him presented, the
ragged but real little Prince of Wales was proclaiming his rights and his
wrongs, denouncing the impostor, and clamouring for admission at the
gates of Guildhall! The crowd enjoyed this episode prodigiously, and
pressed forward and craned their necks to see the small rioter.
Presently they began to taunt him and mock at him, purposely to goad him
into a higher and still more entertaining fury. &nbsp;Tears of mortification
sprang to his eyes, but he stood his ground and defied the mob right
royally. &nbsp;Other taunts followed, added mockings stung him, and he
exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"I tell ye again, you pack of unmannerly curs, I am the Prince of Wales!
And all forlorn and friendless as I be, with none to give me word of
grace or help me in my need, yet will not I be driven from my ground, but
will maintain it!"</p>

<p>"Though thou be prince or no prince, 'tis all one, thou be'st a gallant
lad, and not friendless neither! &nbsp;Here stand I by thy side to prove it;
and mind I tell thee thou might'st have a worser friend than Miles Hendon
and yet not tire thy legs with seeking. Rest thy small jaw, my child; I
talk the language of these base kennel-rats like to a very native."</p>

<p>The speaker was a sort of Don Caesar de Bazan in dress, aspect, and
bearing. &nbsp;He was tall, trim-built, muscular. &nbsp;His doublet and trunks were
of rich material, but faded and threadbare, and their gold-lace
adornments were sadly tarnished; his ruff was rumpled and damaged; the
plume in his slouched hat was broken and had a bedraggled and
disreputable look; at his side he wore a long rapier in a rusty iron
sheath; his swaggering carriage marked him at once as a ruffler of the
camp. &nbsp;The speech of this fantastic figure was received with an explosion
of jeers and laughter. &nbsp;Some cried, "'Tis another prince in disguise!"
"'Ware thy tongue, friend: &nbsp;belike he is dangerous!" &nbsp;"Marry, he looketh
it&mdash;mark his eye!" &nbsp;"Pluck the lad from him&mdash;to the horse-pond wi' the
cub!"</p>

<p>Instantly a hand was laid upon the Prince, under the impulse of this
happy thought; as instantly the stranger's long sword was out and the
meddler went to the earth under a sounding thump with the flat of it.
The next moment a score of voices shouted, "Kill the dog! &nbsp;Kill him!
Kill him!" and the mob closed in on the warrior, who backed himself
against a wall and began to lay about him with his long weapon like a
madman. &nbsp;His victims sprawled this way and that, but the mob-tide poured
over their prostrate forms and dashed itself against the champion with
undiminished fury.

<p>
His moments seemed numbered, his destruction certain,
when suddenly a trumpet-blast sounded, a voice shouted, "Way for the
King's messenger!" and a troop of horsemen came charging down upon the
mob, who fled out of harm's reach as fast as their legs could carry them.
The bold stranger caught up the Prince in his arms, and was soon far away
from danger and the multitude.</p>

<p>Return we within the Guildhall. &nbsp;Suddenly, high above the jubilant roar
and thunder of the revel, broke the clear peal of a bugle-note. &nbsp;There
was instant silence&mdash;a deep hush; then a single voice rose&mdash;that of the
messenger from the palace&mdash;and began to pipe forth a proclamation, the
whole multitude standing listening.</p>

<p>The closing words, solemnly pronounced, were&mdash;</p>

<p>"The King is dead!"</p>

<p>The great assemblage bent their heads upon their breasts with one accord;
remained so, in profound silence, a few moments; then all sank upon their
knees in a body, stretched out their hands toward Tom, and a mighty shout
burst forth that seemed to shake the building&mdash;</p>

<p>"Long live the King!"</p>

</center>
<br><br><br><br>


<p>Poor Tom's dazed eyes wandered abroad over this stupefying spectacle, and
finally rested dreamily upon the kneeling princesses beside him, a
moment, then upon the Earl of Hertford. A sudden purpose dawned in his
face. &nbsp;He said, in a low tone, at Lord Hertford's ear&mdash;</p>

<p>"Answer me truly, on thy faith and honour! &nbsp;Uttered I here a command, the
which none but a king might hold privilege and prerogative to utter,
would such commandment be obeyed, and none rise up to say me nay?"</p>

<p>"None, my liege, in all these realms. &nbsp;In thy person bides the majesty of
England. &nbsp;Thou art the king&mdash;thy word is law."</p>

<p>Tom responded, in a strong, earnest voice, and with great animation&mdash;</p>

<p>"Then shall the king's law be law of mercy, from this day, and never more
be law of blood! &nbsp;Up from thy knees and away! &nbsp;To the Tower, and say the
King decrees the Duke of Norfolk shall not die!"</p>

<p>The words were caught up and carried eagerly from lip to lip far and wide
over the hall, and as Hertford hurried from the presence, another
prodigious shout burst forth&mdash;</p>

<p>"The reign of blood is ended! &nbsp;Long live Edward, King of England!"</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
